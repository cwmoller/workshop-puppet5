## HPC configuration management using Puppet 5

### Premise

All nodes in a compute cluster should conform to a common standard in order to be useful. With a configuration management system, we can ensure conformity and eliminate common errors which impede effective computing.

### Outcomes

In this workshop we will install and configure Puppet 5, a configuration management system, to manage our compute cluster.

We will install and configure the Puppet server, PuppetDB database, a Puppet agent and multiple modules from the Puppet Forge. Best practises will be implemented, including using Hiera and saving configurations to Git.
