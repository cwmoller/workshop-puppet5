# Connect the Puppet Server to the Puppet DB

[Previous](install-puppet-db.md) \| [Home](index.md)

From the [official documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/5.1/connect_puppet_master.html),
>Once PuppetDB is installed and running, configure your Puppet master(s) to use it. When properly connected to PuppetDB, Puppet masters will do the following:
> - Send every nodeâ€™s catalog, facts, and reports to PuppetDB
> - Query PuppetDB when compiling node catalogs that collect exported resources

1. Install Puppet DB termini  
   `sudo yum install puppetdb-termini`
